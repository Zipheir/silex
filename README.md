# silex-r7rs

SIlex is a lexer generator for Scheme written by Danny Dub√©.  Like
(F)lex, it takes a token-action specification as input and produces
a lexical analyzer which can be incorporated into a larger Scheme
program.  It is BSD-licensed and written in portable R5RS Scheme.

This is an attempt to clean up the sprawling SIlex code, document
the tool, and make it run easily on R7RS Scheme implementations.
